# Project Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Introduction

This project  was created for the application to a job in Vizir Software Studio, created in the date 29/03/21 in the local repo and pushed to git in 30/03. The main programming language used was JavaScript in the form of JSX and HTML/CSS.

The project assignment was to create a calculator based in certain specs as shown on the assignment pdf.

The approach used was: provide data via a set of options in a form, creating thus a certain set of parameters to some functions and make it output certain conditional calculations using the base JS Object Deconstruction Methods such as as Object[ key ], if the provided information was good, the results of the functions will be shown in another component below the Form element. 

The other elements in the SPA serve as form to provide the user some UI/UX business value to the ficticious company.

Not every Edge Case was tested and prevented because of time constraints.

# Project Goal

This project was created as an assignment to a job offer in the Vizir Software Studio. 

# Code Splitting

The code splitting pattern in this project was the one recommended by React, splitting the code into components, in place of a monolithic approach, granting them isolation between each other. As so, every instance of code, including the business logic for the calculator component, the method called upon it is located in another file, per React best practices.

# Used dependencies

The dependencies used in the SPA are located in the package.json file, and the main ones other than the ones brought by create-react-app were: React-Bootstrap, React-Icons, Bootstrap-Icons and ES-Lint(AirBnb).

# How to run The SPA

The command `npm start` runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
